# Video rental software

# I want a point of sale solution for Family Video's rivals
# At very minimum it needs to have a stock of 5 rentable titles
# Employee should be able to register new users, rent titles to users, and check titles back in
# Any other functionality is secondary but welcome.
# I don't care how you implement checking in/out, but no shortcuts/fakery
# Don't have to have it done by next week, but iterate so that you can at least demo features as they are completed
